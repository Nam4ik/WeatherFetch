**WeaterFetch: Written on rust fetch tool like Neofetch or FastFetch but with Weather.**
This is my pet project, but I think someone might like it. I am the sole developer, so if you encounter any issues or bugs, please inform me or create a pull request. Stil in development, no work version.

<h2 align="center"> Tech details 🏗️</h2>

> [!WARNING] 
> Not all of this fns can be implemented with openmeteo API 

- Uses the free open-meteo API, which requires coordinates or configuration to function properly.
- Displays images in the terminal. (WIP)
- Provides various time intervals, including daily, hourly, and minute-by-minute updates, as well as current information.
- Can send alerts. (WIP)
- In case of internet connectivity issues, it can download information from a cache.

WIP - work in progress. Its much more harder with free open-meteo API.

<h2 align="center"> Using ⛽️</h2>

>[!WARNING]
>Coordinates and an internet connection are required if cache not builded properly.
>To cache weather data you cah run `wfetch rebuild-cache`
